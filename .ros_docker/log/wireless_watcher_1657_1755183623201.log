[FATAL] [1755183623.254362483] [a200_0000.wireless_watcher]: No wireless device found to monitor.
[WARN] [1755183624.254126840] [a200_0000.wireless_watcher]: diagnostic_updater: No HW_ID was set. This is probably a bug. Please report it. For devices that do not have a HW_ID, set this value to 'none'. This warning only occurs once all diagnostics are OK. It is okay to wait until the device is open before calling setHardwareID.
